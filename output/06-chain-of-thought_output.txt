TECHNIQUE: Mathematical Reasoning Progression
==================================================
Why This Works: CoT prompting improves mathematical reasoning by:
1. Making calculation steps explicit and verifiable
2. Reducing arithmetic errors through systematic approach
3. Enabling validation of intermediate results
4. Providing transparency for error detection and correction

--- Example 1: Standard ---
Approach: Standard
Error: 'problem'
