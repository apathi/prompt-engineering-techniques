--- Example 1: Unknown ---
Response: To solve the problem using Approach #1 (working backwards from the final amount), we can reverse the percentage changes to find the original profit.

1. **Start with the final profit at the end of Yea...

--- Example 2: Unknown ---
Response: To solve the problem using Approach #2 (setting up algebraic equations), we will define the original profit as \( P \).

1. **Profit Increase in Year 1**: The profit increased by 25%. Therefore, the p...

--- Example 3: Unknown ---
Response: To solve the problem using Approach #3 (step-by-step percentage calculations), we will break down the profit changes year by year, working backwards to find the original profit.

### Step 1: Understan...
