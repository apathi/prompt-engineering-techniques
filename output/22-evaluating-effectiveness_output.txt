TECHNIQUE: Multi-Dimensional Assessment
==================================================
Description: Comprehensive evaluation of prompt effectiveness across accuracy, relevance, completeness, clarity, consistency, efficiency, and creativity dimensions
Why This Works: By evaluating prompts across multiple weighted dimensions, we can identify specific strengths and weaknesses, leading to more targeted optimization. Each dimension captures different aspects of communication effectiveness, providing a holistic view of prompt performance that goes beyond simple output quality.

TECHNIQUE: Advanced Optimization Framework
==================================================
Description: Iterative prompt refinement through systematic evaluation, targeting specific weakness areas and measuring improvement across optimization cycles
Why This Works: Optimization frameworks provide structured approaches to prompt improvement by identifying specific areas of weakness, implementing targeted changes, and measuring results. This creates a feedback loop that leads to continuous improvement and helps identify which optimization strategies are most effective for different types of tasks.
Optimization Task: Create clear technical documentation for a REST API endpoint
